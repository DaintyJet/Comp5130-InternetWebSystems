\noindent\textbf{Bare Metal}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Utilize the \textit{setup\_system.sh} script to setup a Linux system for the deployment of this application. This will install the \textit{Node JS} Runtime, and the MongoDB Database
    \item Run \textit{node.sh} to install Node JS for your user! Later versions will be installed in a common directory.
    \item Fill in the dot env file based on the provided template. Run the \textit{npm install} and the the \textit{server.js} file from within the Source directory to start the server and initialize the database if it has not already been done. 
\end{enumerate}


\noindent\textbf{Containerization}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Utilize the \textit{setup\_docker.sh} script to set up a Linux system for the deployment of this application. This will install the \textit{Docker Engine} a container runtime we will use for the deployment of this system.
    \item Modify Environment Variables in the Dockerfiles to enable additional vulnerabilities if desired.
    \item Use Docker Compose on the \textit{docker-compose-single.yml} file to build the container and deploy them.
    \item The results from the build can be deployed to a local registry and later deployed across multiple systems in a Docker Swarm or Kubernetes Cluster.
