# Proposal: The Probably Secure Password Manager
This document contains Scratch notes regarding a proposal for the *Probably Secure Password Manager*.

Please refer to the `TEX` directory.

## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to host your own password manager that is probably secure? Probably not, but this one is practical both inside and outside of a classroom. The main goal of this project is to create dockerized password manager that can be deployed locally that is not only secure, but can also be made insecure.

## Why
Students in a classroom, or in a workplace are always told the importance of passwords and securing the systems that we store them on. There also exist many Vulnerable by Design (VbD) applications used to teach students about software and web security. However, most of these applications like [WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/), [Metasploitable](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) or [Vulnserver](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver) fail to drive the point home to student that these vulnerabilities are in everyday applications that store personal data that thousands or millions of people use!

In order to enrich a student's learning experience, and provide a more realistic scenario for students to explore we plan to create a functional password manager that can be configured to preset levels of security. This will allow instructors to dynamically construct exercises with varying levels of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations applied the the *Probably Secure Password Manager*; from a fully secure password manager to one with more holes than swiss cheese. We also plan to integrate *REST APIs* to allow instructors to configure the *Probably Secure Password Manager* at runtime based on how students are preforming during the activities.

Not only will this allow instructors to make lessons on software and web security stay with the students longer, and make their lessons more interesting but it will also drive home the importance of password security and Multi-Factor Authentication. Unlike [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) the *Probably Secure Password Manager* can easily be self hosted using docker containers and has varying levels of security that can be applied. The most important thing about the *Probably Secure Password Manager* is it's ease of deployment and the limited resources required to run the applications. As this allows anyone to deploy this on a wide range of infrastructures. -->

 <!-- We introduce this full stack application in a series of docker containers that can be deployed on any network; this can be used for a practical purpose with all of the security flags enabled to provide secure password storage. Or we can disable various securityflags to introduce vulnerabilities into the applications. You may be wondering why we would want to introduce vulnerabilities into our **password manager**, and the question is Why Not! There are many viable passowrd manager already in circulation, both open and closed source, some of which are free such as [BitWarden]()  or those that are [LastPass](). These systems have one thing in common, they cannot easily be used in a classroom to show how one critical failure, or flaw can lead to a dat breack that can ruin a persons life. WE aim to provide this experiance for **free** in easy to use docker containers.  -->
