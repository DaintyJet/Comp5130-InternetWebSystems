# Proposal: The Probably Secure Password Manager
This document contains a proposal for the *Probably Secure Password Manager*. Have you ever wanted to host your own password manager that is probably secure? Probably not, but this one is practical both inside and outside of a classroom. We introduce this full stack aplication in a series of docker containers that can be deployed on any network; this can be used for a practical purpose with all of the security flags enabled to provide secure password storage. Or we can disable various securityflags to introduce vulnerabilities into the applications. You may be wondering why we would want to introduce vulnerabilities into our **password manager**, and the question is Why Not! There are many viable passowrd manager already in circulation, both open and closed source, some of which are free such as [BitWarden]()  or those that are [LastPass](). These systems have one thing in common, they cannot easily be used in a classroom to show how one critical failure, or flaw can lead to a dat breack that can ruin a persons life. WE aim to provide this experiance for **free** in easy to use docker containers. 

# Why
This is a containerized program that can easily be deployed in learning enviornments for use by student, this is a program that can have the various compents created or toggeled at runtime to induce insecure, or bad behavior. For example we can allow students leanr about various web-security vulnerabilities..
